	<p class="text-content">
		The default BAMINI application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small
		applications. But you are free to arrange your apps however you want..

	<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Root Directory</h2>
	<div>
		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The App Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>app</code> directory contains the core code of your application. We'll explore this directory in more detail soon; however,
			almost all of the code in your application will be in this directory.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Bootstrap Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>bootstrap</code> directory contains <code>index.js</code> file to bootstrap the framework. This directory also contains a cache directory
			containing skeletonized files for performance optimization, such as routes </p>
		
		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Configs Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>configs</code> directory, as its name suggests, contains all your application configuration files. You should read through
			all of these files and familiarize yourself with all the options available to you.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Database Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>database</code> directory contains your database migrations and seeds. If you wish, you may also use this directory to hold an
			SQLite database.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Interfaces Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>interfaces</code> directory contains interfaces for web and API, we understand that all communication between users and applications, between applications
			and applications, needs to go through interfaces.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Kernel Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>kernel</code> directory contains all service declarations and instantiations, including services integrated into the main activity flow, which
			will be active throughout the life of the framework.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Libs Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>libs</code> directory contains the entire library developed specifically for your project.
		</p>
		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Modules Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>modules</code> directory contains functional modules you can split in your project, this is just an optional.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Notifications Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>notifications</code> directory contains extensions of information you will use in projects such as email templates.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Public Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>public</code> directory houses your assets such as images, JavaScript, CSS and content you want to publish, photos, etc.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Routes Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>routes</code> directory contains all of the route definitions for your application. By default, four route types are included with BAMIMI:
			api, cli, web, socket
		</p>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>api</code> directory contains routes that are intended to be stateless, so requests entering the application through these routes are intended
			to be authenticated via tokens and will not have access to session state.
		</p>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>cli</code> directory is where you may define all of your closure based console commands. Each closure is bound to a command instance allowing
			a simple approach to interacting with each command's IO methods. Even though this file does not define HTTP routes, it
			defines console based entry points (routes) into your application. You may also schedule tasks in the <code>cli</code>.
		</p>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>web</code> directory contains routes that BAMIMI places in the web middleware group, which provides session state,
			CSRF
			protection, and cookie encryption. If your application does not offer a stateless, RESTful API then all your routes
			will
			most likely be defined in this.
		</p>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>socket</code> directory contains all the paths for real-time processing, or publishing events to the client.
		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Storage Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>storage</code> directory contains all the content you want to save such as file uploads, cache, content system.
		</p>
		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"> # The Tests Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>tests</code> directory contains your automated tests. Examples of <code>jest.js</code> tests
			This folder will be placed outside <code>src</code>, in fact during the project build process this folder will not be built
		</p>
		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"> # The Node Modules Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>node_modules</code> directory contains your Packages dependency
		</p>
	</div>

		</p>

			The <code>middleware</code> directory contains files that support logic handling and handling of problems in the entire request.

		</p>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># The Jobs Directory</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			The <code>jobs</code> directory contains the queueable jobs for your application. Jobs may be queued by your application or run synchronously within the current
