			In fact, inexperienced developers often do not pay attention to security issues, leaving the system vulnerable to
			attacks. Common vulnerabilities include <code>SQL Injection</code>, <code>CSRF</code>, <code>XSS</code>, <code>Clickjacking</code>, <code>CORS</code>, etc... Don't worry, BAMIMI
			has tried to handle this vulnerability for you by importing reputable libraries to handle it. You can see it at the
			config <code>configs/security.js</code> and middleware <code>app/http/middleware/security.mid.js</code>

	<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4" id="introduction"># How Did BAMIMI Handle Them?</h2>
	<div>
		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># SQL Injection</h5>
		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate SQL queries by
				injecting malicious input into an application's database query. This can lead to unintended behavior such as
				unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation in the database.
			</p>
			<p class="text-content">
				<strong>BAMIMI handle </strong>: Using <code>Sequelize</code> helps cover the problem of using queries directly in the code, reducing the possibility of passing
				invalid syntax. Besides, you still need to validate data to increase safety.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># CSRF</h5>
		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a> is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application
				in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or
				chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the
				victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like
				transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can
				compromise the entire web application.
			</p>
			<p class="text-content">
				<strong>BAMIMI handle </strong>: Using <code>@knfs-tech/csrf</code> library to determine the real request, see <a href="/docs/1.x.x/?content=me_csrf">CSRF section</a> for details
			</p>
		</div>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># XSS</h5>
		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</a> attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise
				benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally
				in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite
				widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating
				or encoding it.</p>
			<p class="text-content">
				<strong>BAMIMI handle </strong>: Using <a href="https://helmetjs.github.io/">Helmet.js</a> handle X-XSS-Protection enables XSS filtering in the browser, preventing XSS attacks without having to implement
				additional processing logic. Besides, there is support for adding <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xss">Xss</a> to change the tag/script data structure, increasing security.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># Clickjacking</h5>
		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking">Clickjacking</a>, also known as a “UI redress attack”, is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to
				trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top level page.
				Thus, the attacker is “hijacking” clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by
				another application, domain, or both.</p>
			<p class="text-content">
				<strong>BAMIMI handle </strong>: Using <a href="https://helmetjs.github.io/">Helmet.js</a> sets the X-Frame-Options header, protecting the app from displaying web pages in iframes of malicious sites.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># MIME type sniffing</h5>
		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				<a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html">MIME</a> type sniffing is an operation conducted by many browsers. Each browser behaves differently on that matter, but
				overall, MIME sniffing is an action where they determine a page content type depending on that page content. This is can
				be dangerous as it could allow attackers to hide HTML code into a .jpg file, and have the visitor's browser interpret
				the page and execute client code (XSS) because the browser determined the file was HTML code instead of a JPG image.</p>
				<p class="text-content">
					<strong>BAMIMI handle </strong>: Using <a href="https://helmetjs.github.io/">Helmet.js</a> sets the X-Content-Type-Options
					header, prevents the browser from automatically determining the document's MIME type, thereby helping prevent MIME sniffing
					attacks.
				</p>
		</div>

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># CORS</h5>
		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CORS_OriginHeaderScrutiny">CORS</a> stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
				Is a feature offering the possibility for:
				<li>A web application to expose resources to all or restricted domain.</li>
				<li>A web client to make AJAX request for resource on other domain than is source domain.</li>
				This article will focus on the role of the Origin header in the exchange between web client and web application.</p>
