			Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit whereby unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an
			authenticated user. Thankfully, BAMIMI makes it easy to protect your application from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" target="_blank">cross-site request forgery</a> (CSRF)
			attacks.
		</p>
		
		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># An Explanation of the Vulnerability</h5>
		<p class="text-content">
			In case you're not familiar with cross-site request forgeries, let's discuss an example of how this vulnerability can be
			exploited. Imagine your application has a <code>/user/email</code> route that accepts a <code>POST</code> request to change the authenticated
			user's email address. Most likely, this route expects an email input field to contain the email address the user would
			like to begin using.
			
			Without CSRF protection, a malicious website could create an HTML form that points to your application's <code>/user/email</code>
			route and submits the malicious user's own email address:
		</p>
		<div class="position-relative code-container">
			<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-html" id="html-code-csrf"></code></pre>
		</div>
		<p class="text-content">
			If the malicious website automatically submits the form when the page is loaded, the malicious user only needs to lure
			an unsuspecting user of your application to visit their website and their email address will be changed in your
			application.
			
			To prevent this vulnerability, we need to inspect every incoming <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> request for a secret
			session value that the malicious application is unable to access.

	<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4" id="introduction"># Preventing CSRF Requests</h2>
	<div>
		<p class="text-content">
			BAMIMI automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each active user session or cookie (depending on configuration)
			managed by the application. This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the one actually making the
			request to the application. Because this token is stored in the user's session (or cookie) and changes every time the
			session is recreated, it cannot be accessed by a malicious application. 
			The current session's CSRF token can be accessed through the request's session or through the local variable <code>csrfToken</code>:

				<pre class="language-javascript"
				tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript">//@iRoutes/web/index.js
"use strict";
const router = require("express").

const { protect: csrfProtect } = require("@knfs-tech/csrf")

router.post(
	"/save-form", 
	csrfProtect,
	(req, res, next) => {
		console.log(csrfToken)
		next();
	}
);
</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p class="text-content">
			You can also configure further at <code>kernel/index.js</code>:
		</p>
		<div class="position-relative code-container mt-4">
				<pre class="language-javascript"
				tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript">//@iKernel/index.js
"use strict";
...
exports.middleware = {
	...,
	web: [
		...,
		csrf.generate({
			tokenLength: 24,
			storage: {
				type: csrf.CONSTANT.STORAGE.COOKIE,
				options: {
					httpOnly: true,
					maxAge: 1 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1days
					secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? true : false
				}
			}
		}),
		csrf.setTokenLocalsParam, 
		....
	]
}
</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p class="text-content">
			Anytime you define a "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", or "DELETE" HTML form in your application, you should include a hidden CSRF
			<code>_csrf</code> field in the form so that the CSRF protection middleware can validate the request. For convenience, you may use
			the <code>$_csrf.input()</code> Ejs directive to generate the hidden token input field:
