			When using any tool in the real world, you naturally feel more confident when you understand how it works.
			Application
			development is no different. Gaining insight into how your development tools operate can make working with them more
			intuitive and efficient.
		
			The goal of this document is to provide you with a high-level overview of how the BAMIMI framework functions. By
			familiarizing yourself with the framework, everything will feel less "magical," and you'll build your applications
			with
			greater confidence. Don't worry if you don't fully understand all the terms right away! Focus on grasping the key
			concepts, and your understanding will deepen as you explore other sections of the documentation.

		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				The entry point for all http requests to a BAMIMI application is the <code>server.js</code> file. All requests are directed to this file
				by your web server (Apache/Nginx) configuration. The <code>server.js</code> file doesn't contain much code. Rather, it is a
				starting point for loading the rest of the framework. The <code>server.js</code> retrieves an instance of the BAMIMI application from <code>bootstrap/index.js</code>. The first action taken by BAMIMI

			<p class="text-content">
				<strong>Kernel</strong>: When a request comes into the application, it is directed to either the kernel or a specific method in
				<code>kernel/index.js</code>, depending on the request type. These kernels act as central hubs through which all requests are
				processed. For now, let's focus on the HTTP kernel, which is defined in <code>kernel/index.js</code> and uses <code>kernel/router</code>.
				
				The HTTP kernel is designed with a set of bootstrappers that run both before and after handling a request. These
				bootstrappers handle tasks such as configuring error handling, setting up logging, detecting the application's
				environment, and other preliminary setups required before the request is processed. These layers typically deal with
				BAMIMI's internal configuration, so you usually don’t need to manage them directly.
				
				In addition to this, the Kernel manages the flow of the request through the application's middleware stack. This
				middleware handles tasks like managing HTTP sessions, checking if the application is in maintenance mode, verifying CSRF
				tokens, and more. We’ll explore these middleware layers in more detail later.
				
				The Kernel’s `handle` method is straightforward: it accepts a `Request` and returns a `Response`. You can think of the
				kernel as the core of your application—feed it an HTTP request, and it will return the corresponding HTTP response.

		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				The entry point for Websocket requests to the BAMIMI application is the <code>socket.js</code> file. Rather, it is the starting point
				for loading the rest of the socket into the frame. <code>socket.js</code> retrieves an instance of the BAMIMI application from
				<code>bootstrap/socket.js</code>. Where real-time and socket configurations are handled, applying the library

		<h5 class="mb-4 mt-4"># Cli Request</h5>
		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				The first part of the services where most of the work will be done internally by the development team, or ops team. The
				user will run the command to bin the cli, then their task is to manipulate the cli through <code>routes/cli/index.js</code>, here we
				are using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander">Commander library</a>.
				In addition, it also has built-in integration with queue jobs, you can execute jobs via <code>routes/cli/index.js</code>
