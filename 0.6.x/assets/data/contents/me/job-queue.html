			While building your web application, you may have some tasks, such as parsing and storing an uploaded CSV file, that
			take too long to perform during a typical web request. Thankfully, BAMIMI allows you to easily create queued jobs that
			may be processed in the background. By moving time intensive tasks to a queue, your application can respond to web
			requests with blazing speed and provide a better user experience to your customers.
		</p>
		<p class="text-content">
			BAMIMI Queue provides a unified queuing API on Redis.
		</p>
		<p class="text-content">
			BAMIMI's queue configuration options are stored in your application's <code>configs/queue.js</code> configuration file. In this
			you will find the connection configuration for the queue driver that ships with the Redis framework and also the
			synchronous driver that will execute jobs immediately (for use in local development). An empty queue driver is also
			included to remove queued jobs.
		</p>

		<div>
			<p class="text-content">
				Before getting started with BAMIMI queues, it's important to understand the difference between "connections" and
				"queues". In your <code>configs/queue.js</code> configuration file, there is an array of connection configurations. This option
				identifies connections to the Redis backend queue service. However, any queue connection can have multiple "queues"
				which can be thought of as different stacks or stacks of queued work.
