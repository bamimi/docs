			Many web applications provide a way for their users to authenticate with the application and "login". Implementing this
			feature in web applications can be a complex and potentially risky endeavor. For this reason, BAMIMI strives to give
			you the tools you need to implement authentication quickly, securely, and easily.
			
			At its core, BAMIMI's authentication facilities are made up on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knfs-tech/bamimi-auth" target="_blank">@knfs-tech/bamimi-auth</a>. 
			Middleware auth define how users are
			authenticated for each request. For example, BAMIMI ships with a session guard which maintains state using session
			storage and cookies.
			
			Providers define how users are retrieved from your persistent storage. BAMIMI ships with support for retrieving users
			using ORMs. However, you are free to define additional providers as needed for your
			application.
			
			Your application's authentication configuration file is located at <code>configs/auth.js</code>. This file contains several
			well-documented options for tweaking the behavior of BAMIMI's authentication services.
